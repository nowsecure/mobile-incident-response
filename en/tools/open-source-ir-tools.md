# List of mobile incident response tools

There are a number of open-source tools and distributions that can be used in investigating a mobile incident or during a forensic examination.  The use of advanced Linux forensic analysis tools can help an examiner locate crucial evidence in a more efficient manner. Some of these tools are very powerful and provide the capability to quickly index, search, and extract certain types of files.

The following is a list of open source and other freely distributed tools that are available either within the Santoku Linux distribution or elsewhere, broken down by the categories discussed earlier in this chapter. While we don't cover tools that can be used to help establish an efficient IR process, there are a few open source options listed in Meirwah's [Awesome Incident Response](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response) repo (under the "Incident Management" section). 

The tools in the following section that have already been pre-installed within Santoku will be denoted by an "S", while others mentioned will need to be manually installed in the Santoku virtual machine (VM) that you've set up. Commercial tools will be briefly discussed at the end of this section.

## Continual analysis tools
[Vulnerability Test Suite (VTS) for Android](https://github.com/nowsecure/android-vts): Scans an Android device to detect known vulnerabilities. There are two types of vulnerability tests that can be performed:

* Detection only (does not attempt to exploit)
* Detects and attempts to exploit the vulnerability

[iVerify-oss](https://github.com/trailofbits/iverify-oss): Inspects an iOS device at boot-time to identify and collect information about any changes observed that may indicate the device has been modified by a jailbreak or other type of exploit.

[X-Ray](https://labs.duosecurity.com/xray): X-Ray allows you to scan your Android device for security vulnerabilities that put your device at risk. 


## Device and data acquisition tools
This process involves not only acquiring the data from the device but also ensuring that the forensic image you've collected matches the file signature of the original (more details on this in the "[Categories of Mobile IR Tools](../mobile-ir-tool-categories.md)" section). Below is a list of tools that can be used to perform the device acquisition process, verify an image, and collect network traffic (when appropriate).

### Device acquisition
* (S) AF Logical OSE: An open source tool that was released for use by non-law enforcement personnel or other individuals interested in Android forensics. It allows an examiner to extract logical data from an Android device through content providers. Here is a [HOWTO guide](https://santoku-linux.com/howto/howto-use-aflogical-ose-logical-forensics-android/) guide for this tool.
* (S) iPhone Backup Analyzer 2:  Allows user to browse content of iOS device made by an iTunes backup (or backup performed by another tool). More details on this tool can be found in it's [repo](https://github.com/PicciMario/iPhone-Backup-Analyzer-2); otherwise, you can find this tool in Santoku under the start menu -> Santoku -> Device Forensics -> iOS Backup Analyzer 2.
* (S) libimobiledevice: Cross-platform library that uses iOS specific protocols to recover data from the device's filesystem (no jailbreak required), perform a backup/restore, retrieve device information, and more. Here is a [HOWTO guide](https://santoku-linux.com/howto/mobile-forensics/howto-create-a-logical-backup-of-an-ios-device-using-libimobiledevice-on-santoku-linux/) for this tool. You will find the tool in Santoku under the start menu -> Santoku -> Device Forensics -> libimobiledevice.
* (S) dd:  The “dd” command can be used on a device on which the examiner has root access (e.g., a jailbroken iPhone or iPad). This tool is generally used in forensics to acquire a full disk image of a hard drive, SD card, USB flash drive, or other device.
* [FROST](https://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/frost): A tool set that supports the forensic recovery of scrambled telephones. 
* [Lime](https://github.com/504ensicslabs/lime): Allows for the acquisition of volatile memory from Android and other Linux-based devices.

### Image verification 
The following two checksum commands can be used to generate a digital fingerprint of a file, and in forensics, can be used to show that a physical image is an exact replicate of the data on a device at a given time. This verification proves that no files or content have been changed.

* (S) md5sum
* (S) sha256sum

### Proxying network traffic
* [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/): Charles is a proxy tool that allows the user to view requests, responses and HTTP headers for HTTP and SSL/HTTPS traffic.
* (S) [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/):  A platform for security testing web applications, but it can also be used to assess the security of mobile app communications and web services. 
* (S) [ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project): Open source penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Analysis tools
### Forensic analysis
  * (S) Android Brute Force Encryption: This tool can help a forensic analyst crack the pin used to encrypt an Android device (this applies to Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean versions of the Android operating system).  Here is a [HOWTO guide](https://santoku-linux.com/howto/mobile-forensics/how-to-brute-force-android-encryption/) for this tool.
  * (S) scalpel:  A file carving utility that is used to recover deleted files from a forensic image of a device (mobile or not). It recovers these files by searching a disk image for that file type's unique header and footer.
  * (S) [Sleuthkit](http://www.sleuthkit.org/): Sleuthkit is a collection of command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images and recover files from them.
  * (S) strings:  Running this command line tool against any file will provide printable characters that are at least 4 characters long from the file. Strings can really be useful when trying to locate information within a large file, such as a forensic image of a device (which can exceed 16GB depending on the size of the device). It allows for quick and efficient searching when used in combination with the "grep" command.
  * (S) hexedit: No forensic investigation is complete without a hex editor. Hexedit is built into the Santoku VM and can be used to view or manipulate the binary data within a file.

### Network analysis

## Commercial tools
While this section focuses on open-source software (OSS), commercial tools that can also assist in a mobile IR investigation are worth mentioning.

In addition to the list of OSS process/incident management tools that we linked to above, there are also commercial tools available such as [Demisto's Automation and ChatOps Platform for Incident Response](https://www.demisto.com/) or [Resilient's Incident Response Platform](https://www.resilientsystems.com/). This can be used to help automate the IR process by integrating directly with other prevention and detection systems that are already in place. It helps teams track incidents and offers dashboards and reporting features to provide status updates to various groups.

### Continuous monitoring analysis
[NowSecure's Protect mobile application](https://www.nowsecure.com/protect/), when installed in advance of a mobile incident, can help establish a device, operating system, and app baseline. When used within an organization, it provides an administrative dashboard that can allow access to aggregated security scores, network data, and vulnerability analytics. In the event of an incident, this baseline data can be used to pinpoint what went wrong and when.

[zANTI](https://github.com/Zimperium/zanti_plugins): zANTI is a mobile penetration testing toolkit that lets security managers assess the risk level of a network.

### Device acquisition / analysis
